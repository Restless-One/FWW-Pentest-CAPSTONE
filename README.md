OpenVAS integration Purpose: OpenVAS is used for comprehensive vulnerability scanning. Integration method: Use OpenVAS API for automated vulnerability scanning. You can write scripts to call OpenVAS's API to trigger scans, retrieve results, and save them. Export the scan results to CSV or XML format, and then pass these results to VulnWhisperer through scripted tools. Steps:
Use API to create and start scan tasks. Query the scan status regularly until the scan is completed. Automatically pass the scan results to VulnWhisperer for processing.---

OpenVAS Scan Automation Script This Python script (openvas_scan.py) provides a simple way to interact with the OpenVAS API for creating, starting, and retrieving the results of a vulnerability scan. The script is designed to automate the process of scanning targets for vulnerabilities using OpenVAS.

Features Create scan tasks: Automatically create a vulnerability scan task using OpenVAS. Start scan tasks: Start the scan and monitor its progress. Retrieve scan results: Once the scan is completed, retrieve the results. Prerequisites Before running the script, make sure you have:

A working installation of OpenVAS (also known as Greenbone Vulnerability Management). Access to OpenVAS's API and an API Token for authentication. Python 3 installed on your system. The requests module installed in your Python environment: bash pip install requests Setup Step 1: Clone the repository or create the script You can either clone this repository or manually create the openvas_scan.py file in your working directory.

bash git clone Or manually create the script:

bash touch openvas_scan.py Step 2: Modify the script You need to edit the script to include your specific OpenVAS configuration:

Replace with the IP address or domain name of your OpenVAS server. Replace with the API token you generated from the OpenVAS web interface. Replace <target_id> and <scanner_id> with the actual target and scanner IDs from your OpenVAS server. Example configuration in the script:

python url = "https://10.0.2.15:9392/gmp" headers = { "Content-Type": "application/json", "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" } Step 3: Run the script Navigate to the directory where the script is located and run it with Python:

bash python3 openvas_scan.py Step 4: Review scan results Once the scan is completed, the script will print the scan results to the console. You can modify the script to save the results to a file if needed.

Script Overview create_scan_task(): This function creates a new scan task using the OpenVAS API. start_scan(task_id): Starts the scan task by passing the task_id obtained from the task creation step. get_scan_status(task_id): Polls the status of the scan task to check if it has been completed. get_scan_results(task_id): Once the scan is complete, retrieves the results of the scan. Example Usage Here is a simple outline of how the script works:

The script first creates a new scan task with the provided target and scanner IDs. It starts the scan and monitors the status. Once the scan is completed, the results are fetched and displayed. python if name == "main": task = create_scan_task() task_id = task['data']['id'] start_scan(task_id) status = get_scan_status(task_id) if status == 'completed': results = get_scan_results(task_id) print(results) Troubleshooting Invalid API Token: Ensure your API token is correct and valid. Network Issues: Make sure your Python environment can reach the OpenVAS server (check firewall or network settings). Incorrect Target/Scanner ID: Make sure the target_id and scanner_id are correctly set. License This project is licensed under the MIT License.
