### **Top Summary Section**

  

At the top of the dashboard, display the key metrics:

  

• **Number of Vulnerabilities Found**: Displays the total number of vulnerabilities identified across all scans.

• **Number of Critical Issues**: Displays the number of critical issues found (e.g., severe vulnerabilities).

• **Recent Scans**: Displays the number of scans conducted recently (e.g., over the past week or month).

  

#### **Distribution of Vulnerabilities by Severity**

  

This table uses a **pie chart** to display the distribution of vulnerabilities by severity, clearly showing the proportion of each severity level.

  

**Pie Chart: Vulnerability Severity Distribution**

  

• **Categories**:

• Critical

• High

• Medium

• Low

• No Risk

• Each part of the pie chart uses different colors to represent the different severity levels, helping users quickly understand the system’s security posture.

  

### ** Combined Bar Chart**

  

**Combined Bar Chart: Monthly Vulnerability and Critical Issue Counts**

  

• The originally separated bar charts are combined into a single **bar chart**. Different colored bars represent the **total number of vulnerabilities** and **number of critical issues**, with both metrics distinguished in the bars for each month.

• **X-axis**: Months (e.g., January, February, etc.). The bars are shown based on the current month of the year. For example, if it’s June 2024, it will display data from January to June, with six bars; if it’s July, there will be seven bars.

• **Y-axis**: Count, representing the total number of vulnerabilities and critical issues.

  

**Chart Details:**

  

• Each month’s bar is split into two sections:

• **Vulnerabilities**: Represents the total number of vulnerabilities found that month (e.g., blue color).

• **Critical Issues**: Represents the number of critical issues found that month (e.g., red color).

• For example, if the dashboard is opened in June 2024, the chart will show six bars from January to June. Each bar will have two sections:

• The blue section represents the total number of vulnerabilities.

• The red section represents the number of critical issues.

• If opened in January 2025, only the January data will be displayed, with a single bar.

  

### **Dashboard Layout Flow**

  

1. **Top Summary Section**: Quickly presents the current system’s security status, including the total number of vulnerabilities, critical issues, and scans conducted.

2. **Pie Chart: Vulnerability Distribution by Severity**: Helps users understand the proportion of each severity level and gives an easy-to-digest overview of the overall risk profile.

3. **Combined Bar Chart: Scan Results Comparison**: The combined bar chart displays both the total number of vulnerabilities and critical issues found each month. The chart dynamically adjusts to the current month, showing trends in vulnerabilities and critical issues throughout the year.

  

### **Chart Dynamic Display Logic**

  

1. **Year-Based Display**: The bar chart displays data only for the current year. Each January, the chart starts fresh and shows only the data for that year. As the months progress, more bars are added to reflect new data.

2. **Month-Based Changes**: As the months progress, the number of bars increases, with one additional bar for each new month. For example, in June, there will be six bars, while in July, there will be seven bars.

3. **Combined Data Display**: Each bar represents both the total number of vulnerabilities and critical issues, making it easy to compare the overall security state and critical problems for each month.

4. **New Year Display**: When entering a new year, the chart resets to display only the data from the new year. For example, in January 2025, only January’s data will be shown with a single bar.
