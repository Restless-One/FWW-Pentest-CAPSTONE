### Database Design Outline

This design involves two tables: **Scan** and **Vulnerabilities**, where each **Vulnerability** is associated with a **Scan** through a foreign key relationship.

---

### **Database 1: Scan**

This table stores details about each scan conducted, including information like the target IP, summary of results, and the scan's status. Each scan can be linked to multiple vulnerabilities in the **Vulnerabilities** table.

| **Field Name**   | **Type**                                              | **Description**                            | **Constraints**             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `id`             | INT (Primary Key, Auto Increment)                     | Unique identifier for each scan.           | Primary Key, Auto Increment |
| `result_summary` | TEXT                                                  | A summary of the results of the scan.      | NULL allowed                |
| `target_ip`      | VARCHAR(45)                                           | The IP address of the scan's target.       | NOT NULL                    |
| `time`           | DATETIME                                              | The timestamp when the scan was conducted. | NOT NULL                    |
| `status`         | ENUM('pending', 'in-progress', 'completed', 'failed') | The current status of the scan.            | NOT NULL                    |

#### **Scan Table Explanation:**
- **id**: A unique auto-incremented identifier for each scan.
- **result_summary**: Stores a brief summary of the scan's findings (e.g., "5 vulnerabilities found, 1 critical issue").
- **target_ip**: Stores the target's IP address (supports both IPv4 and IPv6 with a length of 45 characters).
- **time**: Stores the date and time when the scan was initiated.
- **status**: Indicates the scan's current state, with predefined values such as:
  - `pending`: The scan is queued and has not yet started.
  - `in-progress`: The scan is currently being conducted.
  - `completed`: The scan has finished.
  - `failed`: The scan failed to complete.

### **Database 2: Vulnerabilities**

This table stores information about vulnerabilities discovered during a scan. It is linked to the **Scan** table via a foreign key (`scan_id`), indicating which scan found the specific vulnerability.

| **Field Name** | **Type**                                             | **Description**                                           | **Constraints**                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `id`           | INT (Primary Key, Auto Increment)                    | Unique identifier for each vulnerability.                 | Primary Key, Auto Increment                  |
| `scan_id`      | INT                                                  | Foreign key linking the vulnerability to a specific scan. | Foreign Key (references Scan `id`), NOT NULL |
| `description`  | TEXT                                                 | Detailed description of the vulnerability.                | NOT NULL                                     |
| `severity`     | ENUM('critical', 'high', 'medium', 'low', 'no risk') | Severity level of the vulnerability.                      | NOT NULL                                     |
| `mitigation`   | TEXT                                                 | Suggested mitigation for resolving the vulnerability.     | NULL allowed                                 |

#### **Vulnerabilities Table Explanation:**
- **id**: A unique auto-incremented identifier for each vulnerability.
- **scan_id**: Foreign key that links the vulnerability to the corresponding scan. This ensures each vulnerability is associated with a specific scan.
- **description**: Provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability (e.g., "SQL Injection found on login page").
- **severity**: Stores the severity of the vulnerability, with predefined values such as:
  - `critical`: A severe vulnerability that can cause significant damage if exploited.
  - `high`: A serious issue that requires immediate attention.
  - `medium`: A vulnerability that is less urgent but still needs addressing.
  - `low`: A minor issue with minimal impact.
  - `no risk`: A finding that does not pose any security risk.
- **mitigation**: Suggested actions or strategies to mitigate the vulnerability (e.g., "Sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection").

---

### **Relationship Between Tables**

- **One-to-Many Relationship**: Each scan can identify multiple vulnerabilities, meaning the **Scan** table has a one-to-many relationship with the **Vulnerabilities** table.
- The **Vulnerabilities** tableâ€™s `scan_id` field links back to the `id` field in the **Scan** table to associate each vulnerability with a specific scan.

## Report 

Report can be generate in the page scan, end of the scan data base table give a bottom for download the report for PDF file.

report gonna integrate both scan data and vulnerabilities data. with the status attribute, also export the information when scan status was during process and fail, give the details of time, ip, explanation, suggestion etc.
